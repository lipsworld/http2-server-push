# HTTP/2 Server Push for WordPress

HTTP/2 is the newest version of the HTTP protocol that powers the Web. Based on the SPDY protocol from Google, it uses multiple binary *streams* to transmit more than one file over one connection at the same time. *Server Push* is how an HTTP/2 server starts sending additional files, such as JavaScript and CSS, to the browser before the browser realizes it needs them.

This plugin enables server push for local JavaScript and CSS resources enqueued in the page. Plugins & themes that
output tags directly in the page markup won't be affected.

Tested with [nghttpx](https://nghttp2.org/documentation/nghttpx-howto.html) and [h2o](https://h2o.examp1e.net). LiteSpeed and OpenLiteSpeed do not currently support server push, but this plugin is expected to work seamlessly once they support this feature.
